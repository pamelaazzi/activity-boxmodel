        <p>Lamb of God is an American metal band from Richmond, Virginia.

        <p>Since its formation, Lamb of God has released seven studio albums (including one released under "Burn the Priest"), one live album, one compilation album and three DVDs.

        <h2>Genre</h2>
        <p>Although Lamb Of God's genre is commonly disputed by fans and critics alike, they are mainly considered groove metal. John Campbell, on the Walk With Me in Hell DVD, says that Lamb of God is "a punk band that plays heavy metal", while Chris Adler refers to Sacrament as a speed metal album. Burn the Priest and early Lamb of God has been defined as thrash metal, death metal and hardcore punk or grindcore.
The band also incorporates thrash metal elements, which was shown as a direction on Resolution and Wrath. The band has been described by critics as metalcore. In a 2013 interview with Metal Trails John Campbell described Lamb of God's music as hyper-intelligent, good looking, heavy metal.</p>
